# st - the simple terminal

This is my personal build of st, the simple terminal by suckless. It has everything I need:
1. gruvbox-theme with switching using F6
1. output scrollback with Shift+PageUp / Shift+PageDown or Shift+mousewheel
1. URL opening and copying (thanks to Luke Smith)
1. transparency
1. Fira Code Nerd Font
